rcfiles
=======

My personal RC files (zshrc, screenrc, vimrc...)

Note that the installation script installs
* oh-my-zsh and two plugins, then configures the template. (the zshrc file in this repo is only here in case I don't want oh-my-zsh)
* spacemacs, then copies .spacemacs configuration file
* Copies configuration for vim, screen, bash and other...
* Adds one of my favorite git alias in global configuration.

Usage:
`./deploy.sh myuser /home/myuser`
